# 🌐 DecentraLabs

**Decentralizing access to science, one lab at a time.**

Welcome to **DecentraLabs**: an open-source, community-driven initiative working to reshape how online laboratories are accessed, shared, and sustained across the globe. We leverage **blockchain**, **smart contracts**, and **open protocols** to build the future of **remote experimentation** for education, research, and innovation.

> 🧪 *"Imagine a world where anyone, anywhere, can access a real lab in seconds. We're building that world."*

## 🚀 What We’re Building

DecentraLabs is more than just code; it's an ecosystem.

- ⚙️ **Smart Contracts** for decentralized lab registration, reservation, and payment.  
- 🧠 **$LAB Token** — A fungible token that fuels incentives and sustainability.  
- 🖥️ **Marketplace dApp** — A decentralized web application to discover and book online labs.  
- 🔐 **Federated Authentication** — Support for both crypto wallets *and* institutional SSO (e.g., eduGAIN).  
- 🌍 **Access Control Integration Service** — Seamlessly connect smart lab platforms to the decentralized protocol.  
- 📖 **Specifications, Docs & Guides** — So anyone can contribute, replicate, or extend.

All under a **fully open-source license**, free to use, build upon, and remix.

## 🌱 Why It Matters

For 20+ years, online laboratories (OLs) have existed—but few have survived. Why?

❌ Lack of incentives  
❌ Lack of interoperability  
❌ Centralized gatekeepers  
❌ Sustainability problems  

We're solving this by building a **trustless**, **transparent**, and **tokenized** ecosystem where:

:heavy_check_mark: Institutions get rewarded for sharing their labs 🎓  
:heavy_check_mark: Students and researchers get global, verifiable access 🌐  
:heavy_check_mark: Everyone benefits from a **fair, open, and decentralized model** 🔁
